## Cave Diver
### Description
Cave diver is a game made following [Dylan Bennett's Tutorial](https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1). A few things were changed, such as sprites, sounds, behavior and even the code itself, which is now object-oriented.

In this game, you control a bird that has to dive into a cave. You have to avoid the walls at all costs, or you'll lose. As you progress, your score will increase, so try to get as far as you can!
